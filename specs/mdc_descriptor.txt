A file is divided into 1-64 flows each containing a part of file. All flows contains
approssimatively the same quantity of data. Any difference can be seen between last flow and
others. Each flow contain any descriptors. All flows contains the same number of descriptors.
Each descriptor contains approssimatively the same quantity of data correlated to its flow.
Any difference can be seen between last descriptor of the last flow and the overall other
descriptors. Each descriptor is formed as the follow:

3 bytes  	"MDC"
1 byte		version (=0)
4 bytes		"DESC"
??		    stream_id (null terminated) (hash md5 of the stream in version=0)
1 byte		flow_id
4 bytes		sequence_number
??			codec name (null terminated)
4 bytes		codec parameters size
??			codec parameters (depends on codec)
2 bytes		payload size
??			payload
