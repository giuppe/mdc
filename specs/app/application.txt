sending-manager (called by site-manager) should:
-respond to LIST with ALST
--searching his repository of mdc streams

-respond to PEER with APER
--searching in his repository of peers

-update collection of peers
--every time somebody asks for a stream, add him to the list of peers
--external parts of the app can add an ip to the list 

-respond to SINF with ASNF
--getting stream meta-data, reading them from repository of streams

-respond to SREQ with ASRQ
--sending ASRQ
--filling the "list of stuff to send" for the sender




sender (asynchronous) should:
-iterate through a list of stuff to send, sending it
--this list reports: ip and port of the receiver, stream hash, flow id and sequence id
--then it extract the corresponding descriptor, serialize it and send to specified ip:port



receiver (asynchronous) should: (manage data packet)
-listen on port 5552

-receive every descriptor

-filter every descriptor with the help of a list, filled with result of ASRQs
--the list contains: sender ip and stream hash
--if the new descriptor fits on these constraints, write it to disk



client-manager should:
-integrate tightly with User Interface
-send LIST when user prefers
-displaying results when receiving ALST
--maintaining a "list of last searches"


receive-manager (called by site-manager):
-on ASRQ, add sender specification to list of receiver filtering



site-manager (asynchronous): (manage control packets)
-listen on port 5551
-receive packets
-assign them to managers


stream-manager (asynchronous):
-refresh stream repository regularly
