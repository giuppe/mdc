The MDC text codec function take a stream containing the text file and an empty md_stream
that must be filled with flows and descriptors. The code() function cycles on flows and
sequences numbers and, if the stream not be at end of file, create a new empty descriptor.
Now fills up the descriptor with corrects value as follows: 

Byte		Content
dimension	description

---------	-----------

3 bytes  	"MDC"
1 byte		version
4 bytes		"DESC"
??			stream hash (null terminated)
?? 			stream file name (null terminated)
1 byte		flow_id
4 bytes		sequence_number
??			codec name (null terminated)
4 bytes		codec parameters size
2 bytes		payload size
??			payload

For text codec is not necessary and has been added only the codec parameters size that is 0.
The payload is extracted from the stream and added to the current descriptor.
The "offset" parameter is used to monitorize the getting data procedure.
