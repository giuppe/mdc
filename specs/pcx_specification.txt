pcx_mdc codec specification.

1) Goal
Share out pcx file into N flows with a common header and recreate the original
image with same or less quality.

2)MDC_PCX file header format
	Byte		Content
	dimension	description
	
	---------	-----------
	
	3 bytes  	"MDC"
	1 byte		version
	4 bytes		"DESC"
	1 byte		flow_id
	4 bytes		sequence_number
	??			codec name (null terminated)
	4 bytes		codec parameters size
	128 bytes	codec parameters
	2 bytes		payload size
	??			payload


3) Convert pcx into a pcx_mdc (Code)
3.1)Open file
Load data from file to memory into a char vector.
3.2)Code

This method receive 2 stream pointer. The first one is a stream contains file
data, the second one is the container for our pcx_mdc data.
First of all we extract the first 128byte (header) of pcx data.
After the method cycles on data and part pixel data into descriptors. Each
descriptor have a flow number that suggest the flow which belongs. 
In each descriptor we insert the header (look MDC_PCX file header format) that 
contains the codec parameters that we extracted from pcx_file data.
The encoder read the data and flow bytes alternating pixel into flows  
(ex. 2 flows: flow1 even-numbered pixel, flow2 odd-numbered pixel)


4) Convert pcx_mdc into a pcx (Decode)
4.1) Decode
The decoder receive mcd_file's data stream. It take the flows number and take
the available flows. It reconstruct the pcx data with all available flows
(if all, will be reconstructed the original image else the reconstructed image 
will have same resolution but less details )

4.2) Write file
Write the pcx decoded file to disk.
