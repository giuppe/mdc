The MDC text codec function take a stream containing the image file and an empty md_stream
that must be filled up with flows and descriptors. The code() function cycles on flows and
sequences numbers and, if the stream not is at end of file, create a new empty descriptor.
Now fills up the descriptor with corrects value as follows: 

Byte		Content
dimension	description

---------	-----------

3 bytes  	"MDC"
1 byte		version
4 bytes		"DESC"
1 byte		flow_id
4 bytes		sequence_number
??			codec name (null terminated)
4 bytes		codec parameters size
?? 			codec parameters
2 bytes		payload size
??			payload

First 8 byte are fixed and does not varying during the coding procedure.
Stream hash is an hash extracted from the stream's file name. Subsequently, there is the
real file name ending ".mdc".

Flow id is an identifier of a single flow in a MDC text stream. Is strongly reccomended to 
set this value to a base 2 multiple between 2 and 64 value. But is also possible to set this
value at any integer value from 1 to 64 flows. Coded file will contain the exact flows
number indicated.

Sequence number is a value that takes count of single descriptors, but it's used by
algorithm as a user independent parameter.

Codec name is the name of codec: in this case it's "image".

For image codec the "codec parameter" and has been added with 5 bytes size. These bytes
represents the image width (2 bytes), height (2 bytes) and number of bits used for coding
colours for each pixel (1 byte).

Payload size is the size of payload of a single descriptor and contains a value, for image
implementation, between 10 and 18.330 pixels. This value represents the user preferred
payload size. The algorithm can vary it if it's necessary for load balacing between
descriptors and flows: the product between flows number and real descriptor payload must
approximate as best as possible image file size (it's a lower bound).

The payload is extracted from the stream from an initial point called "offset", pixels
are extracted from a round robin like algorithm to fill up a payload of approssimativaly size
"max_payload_size". Then, payload is added to the current descriptor. The "offset" parameter
is used to monitorize this procedure.

The stream contains a copy of image file contents.




Payload contains parts of the image; division is made out of this algorithm:
Specifing flows_number, preferred_payload, and file_size,
1) Compute flow_size as file_size/flows_number,
2) compute descriptors_number, as flow_size/preferred_payload
3) compute max_payload_size, as flow_size/descriptor_number
4) append nth pixel of image to descriptor which flow_id=(n%flows_number) and desc_id=n%max_payload_size
