*Multiple Description Coding* is the subdivision of a data stream (images, sound or video) in several "descriptions". 
Each description has part of the data, and it can (alone) reconstruct the original stream with an inferior quality.

This is an experimental project started by the ARTS group of Universit√† Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria.
